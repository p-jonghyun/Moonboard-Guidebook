# Moonboard Guidebook üåù

## What does it do?

The goal is to allow you to view, filter and sort Moonboard problems through an intuitive, responsive website.

## What does it not do?

You can't use it to light up the LEDs on an actual Moonboard, but once you find a climb you can search for its name on the app.

## Why does it exist?

The official Moonboard app is slow, unintuitive, and lacks many features. This website aims to be a better way to find climbs.
